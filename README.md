# AWS Automation Examples with Boto3

This repository showcases various examples of automating tasks within the AWS (Amazon Web Services) ecosystem using Boto3, the official AWS SDK for Python.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this repository is for me to experiment with boto3 to showcase practical examples of how to automate common tasks and workflows within the AWS environment using Python and Boto3. AWS offers a wide range of services for cloud computing, machine learning, storage, database management, and more. Automating these tasks using Boto3 can help streamline processes, improve efficiency, and reduce manual intervention.


## Examples

The examples in this repository cover a diverse range of AWS services and use cases, including:

- Analyzing EC2 instances
- Interacting with S3 buckets for storage management
- Machine Learning examples such as performing image and text analysis with Rekognition and Comprehend
- Analyzing data with Athena
- Managing IAM users and roles
- And much more!
